            <p><b>2002–2011: Debut, breakthrough, and commercial success</b><br>Prabhas started his film career with Eeswar (2002). In 2003, he was the lead in Raghavendra.<br><br>

                In 2004, he appeared in Varsham and Adavi Raamudu. He received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the former.<br><br>
                
                In 2005, he appeared in Chakram and in the film Chatrapathi, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, in which he portrays the role of a refugee, exploited by goons. It had a 100-day run in 54 centers.[26] Idlebrain.com stated that he had a unique style and macho charm in his screen presence.[27] Chatrapathi earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.<br><br>
                
                Later, he starred in the dance drama Pournami (2006), the action film Yogi (2007) and the action drama Munna (2007). This was followed by the action-comedy Bujjigadu in 2008. In 2009, his two films were Billa and Ek Niranjan. Indiaglitz called Billa "stylish and visually rich".[28] Ek Niranjan earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.<br><br>
                
                In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon release. The Times of India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."[29]</p>
